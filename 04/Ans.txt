1)
I follow DDD for naming and coding standards, use TDD for testing and refactoring,
review documentation, ensure consistency with existing patterns,
reuse components, and get peer reviews for quality.

2)
I have worked with Laravel, CodeIgniter and CakePHP before and they follow MVC architecture.
MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a design pattern that separates an application into three components:

Model: Manages data and business logic.
View: Displays UI and data.
Controller: Handles requests and updates Model/View.
It improves maintainability and scalability.
Ofc, we can add more layers like Service, Repository, etc. for better separation of concerns.

3)
Yes, I have experience with Git and platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket for version control.
Different branches (main, dev, feature, fix, bug), merging, and collaboration in team environments.

4)
For server-side development, I use PHP (Laravel, CodeIgniter), MySQL, Postman (API testing), Docker (containerization), and VS Code/ PhpStorm (Depending on the mood :D).
For frontend, I use JavaScript, jQuery, Vue.js, TailwindCSS, and Bootstrap.

5)
I have worked with Linux, Ubuntu, AWS EC2.
I have setup Apache, and Nginx for server environments, handling deployments, SSH access, and basic configurations.
I have minimal experience with Docker and good experience with GitHub CI/CD pipelines.

6)
I have worked with MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL (for Blueprint Capital),
and NoSQL databases in freelance projects, handling queries, migrations, and database design.
I have experience with Eloquent ORM in Laravel and Query Builder in CodeIgniter.
I have also worked with Redis for caching, queuing and session management.

7)
On basis of pattern increase, decrease, increase, decrease and then next comes increase
It will be 25 + 5 = 30

8)
It follows an alternating pattern as given:
Multiply by 3
Subtract 3

So, 207 − 3 = 204

9)
It follows an alternating pattern as given:

Divide by 4
Multiply by 2

So, 36 ÷ 4 = 9

10)
Following this pattern, the next number should be:

4 × 3 = 12
